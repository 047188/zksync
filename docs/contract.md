## Deployment

The contract must be deployed specifying the initial ("genesis") state root hash, appointing the **network governor** (see the "Governance" section), and linking the exit queue (see the "Cenosorship resistance" section).

## Governance

Governance of the network will be excerised from a separate contract registered in the Franklin contract as `networkGovernor`. It has the power to:

- Change the set of validators.
- Add new tokens (tokens can not be removed after being added).
- Initiate migration to a new contract (see the "Migration" section).

## Cenosorship resistance

To enforece censorship-resistance and enable guaranteed retrievability of the funds, Franklin employs the mechanisms of **Priority queue** (soft enforcement) and **Exodus mode** (hard enforcement).

## Deposits

To make deposit, a user can:
- Either send ETH to smart contract (will be handled by the default function),
- or call `depositERC20()` function to perform transferFrom for a registered ERC20 token. Note: the user must have previously called approve() on the ERC20 token contract in order to authorize Franklin contract to perform this operation.

This deposit creates a **priority request** that is placed in corresponding priority requests mapping and also emits **NewPriorityRequest(opType, pubData, expirationBlock)** event to notify validators that they must include this request to upcoming blocks. Complete **PriorityQueue** logic that handles **priority requests** is described in **Priority Requests** section.

When a validator commits a block which contains a **circuit operations** `deposit`, than their count will be added to **priority requests** count for this block.

If the block is reverted, the funds held by this blocks' **Deposit priority requests** are acrued to the owners' **root-chain balances** to make them possible to withdraw.

## Withdrawals

### Partial withdrawal

It is a standard withdrawal operation. When a block with a `partial_exit` **circuit operation** is committed, an **Withdraw onchain operation** for this withdrawal is created. If the block is verified, funds from the **Withdrawal onchain operation** are acrued to the users' **root-chain balances**. 

If the block is reverted, this **Withdraw onchain operations** are simply discarded.

A user can withdraw funds from the **root-chain balance** at any time by calling a `withdrawETH()` or `withdrawERC20()` function.

### Full exit

User can request this expensive operation to withdraw funds if he thinks that his transactions are censored by validators.

The user must send a transaction to **Franklin** contract function `registerFullExit()`. This function creates a **priority request** that is placed in corresponding priority requests mapping and also emits **NewPriorityRequest(opType, pubData, expirationBlock)** event to notify validators that they must include this request to upcoming blocks. Complete **PriorityQueue** logic that handles **priority requests** is described in **Priority Requests** section.

When a validator commits a block which contains a **circuit operation** `full_exit`, the corresponding **Withdraw onchain operation** for this withdrawal is created. If the block is verified, funds from the **Withdrawal onchain operation** are acrued to the users' **root-chain balances**.

If the block is reverted, this **Withdraw onchain operations** are simply discarded.

## Block committment

Only a sender from the validator set can commit a block.

The number of committed but unverified blocks is limited by `MAX_UNVERIFIED_BLOCKS` constant in order to make sure that gas is always sufficient to revert all committed blocks if the verification has not happened in time.

## Block verification

Anybody can perform verification for the committed block.

## Reverting expired blocks

If the first committed block was not verified within `EXPECT_VERIFICATION_IN` ETH blocks, all unverified blocks are moved to a separate list `blocksToRevert`. After that, anybody can release the funds held in **onchain operations** by each block by calling a `revertBlock()` function (the validator who created the block is supposed to do this, because they will get compensation for the money spent on the block -- to be implemented for multi-validator version).

## Priority queue

This queue will be implemented in separate contract to ensure that priority operations like `deposit` and `full_exit` will be processed in a timely manner and will be included in one of Franklin's blocks (a situation that leads to the need to reverse blocks will not happen), and also, in the case of `full_exit` transactions, the user can always withdraw funds (censorship-resistance). Its' functionality is divided into 2 parts: **Requests Queue** and **Exodus Mode**.

**NewPriorityRequest** event is emitted when a user send according transaction to Franklin contract. Also some info about it will be stored in the mapping (operation type and expiration block) strictly in the order of arrival.
**NewPriorityRequest** event structure:
- `opType` - operation type
- `pubData` - request data
- `expirationBlock` - the number of Ethereum block when request becomes expired
`expirationBlock` is calculated as follows:
`expirationBlock = block.number + 250` - about 1 hour for the transaction to expire, `block.number` - current Ethereum block number.

When corresponding transactions are found in the commited block, their count must be recorded. If the block is verified, this count of the satisfied **priority requests** is removed from mapping. 

If the block is reverted, the funds held by **Deposit priority requests** from this block are acrued to the owners' **root-chain balances** to make them possible to withdraw. And this **Deposit priority requests** will be removed from mapping. 

### **Validators'** responsibility

**Validators** MUST subscribe for `NewPriorityRequest` events in the RIGHT order to include priority transactions in some upcoming blocks.
The need for _Validators_ to include these transactions in blocks as soon as possible is dedicated by the increasing probability of entering the **Exodus Mode** (described below).

A certain value of the selected token will be withdrawn from the _user's_ account, as payment for the _validatorâ€™s_ work to include these transactions in the block. One transaction fee is calculated as follows:
`fee = 3 * gas * mediumFee`, where
- `gas` - the gas cost of all related operations for the exit
- `mediumFee` - current average fee in the network.

### Exodus mode

If the **Requests Queue** is being processed too slow, it will trigger the **Exodus mode** in **Franklin** contract. This moment is determined by the first (oldest) **priority request** with oldest `expirationBlock` value . If `current ethereum block number >= oldest expiration block number` the **Exodus Mode** will be entered.

In the **Exodus mode**, the contract freezes all block processing, and all users must exit. All existing block commitments will be reverted.

Every user will be able to submit a SNARK proof that she owns funds in the latest verified state of Franklin by calling `exit()` function. If the proof verification succeeds, the entire user amount will be accrued to her **onchain balance**, and a flag will be set in order to prevent double exits of the same token balance.

## Migration

(to be implemented later)

Franklin shall always have a strict opt-in policy: we guarantee that user funds are retrievable forever under the conditions a user has opted in when depositing funds, no matter what. A migration to a newer version of the contract shall be easy and cheap, but MUST require a separate opt-in or allow the user to exit.

The update mechanism shall follow this workflow:

- The **network governor** can schedule an update, specifying a target contract and an ETH block deadline.
- A scheduled update can not be cancelled (to proceed with migration even if exodus mode is activated while waiting for the migration; otherwise we would need to recover funds scheduled for migration with a separate procedure).
- Users can opt-in via a separate Franklin operation: move specific token balance into a subtree on a special migration account. This subtree must also maintain and update counters for total balances per token.
- The migration account MUST have a dedicated hardcoded account_id (to specify).
- When the scheduled ETH block is reached, anybody MUST be able to seal the migration.
- After the migration is sealed, anybody MUST be able to transfer total balances for each token by providing a SNARK proof of the amounts from the migration account subtree.
- When the migration is sealed, the contract enters exodus mode: whoever has not opted in can now exit. Thus, the root state will remain frozen.
- The new contract will read the latest state root directly from the old one (this is safe, because the root state is frozen and can not be changed).

## Todo / Questions / Unsorted

- introduce key hash?
- deploy keys separately?
- unit conversion: different by token?
- describe authorization for ERC20 transferFrom
- enforce max deposits/exits per block in the circuit
